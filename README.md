# ms-comp-challenge-2

This is the second Static Composition challenge in Module 1 for Turing School of Software and Design. The goal is to match the layout of the original comp while creating a site with new copy, fonts, colors, and theme that is still cohesive and appealing. I chose to make my site a spell sharing site for witches. I chose witches because their connectedness to nature and owning of their womanhood really appeals to me. The site is fully responsive. Cards are laid out using CSS Grid.
